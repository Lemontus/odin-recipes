    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I threw this dish of penne pasta, pancetta bacon, and mushrooms together one afternoon for lunch.</p>
    <p>You can find the recipe below.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta bacon, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook penne uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium heat until browned but not crispy, about 5 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate and set aside. Discard pancetta grease.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in same skillet over medium-high heat; stir in mushrooms. Cook and stir until mushrooms softened and released their liquid. Add garlic; cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cream and Italian seasoning. Simmer until sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Off heat, add penne to sauce; toss to coat. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese; serve.</li>
    </ol>
